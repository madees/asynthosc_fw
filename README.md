# AsynthOsc Zephyr RTOS firmware

This repository contains the firmware application for the AsynthOsc project.
The hardware design for the board is available [here](https://github.com/everedero/asynth2osc).

This board is based upon STM32H743VITx.

This repository depends on the Zephyr project.
The [manifest](west.yml) is used the select the compatible Zephyr version.

[zephyr]: https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr

Note: do not "git clone" this project, see installation instructions to run
"west init" in order to initialize the project.

## Features
The features of this firmware are documented here :
[https://everedero.github.io/asynth2osc/]: https://everedero.github.io/asynth2osc/

## Session guide

For a single-entry startup document with quick commands and a full documentation
index, see [PROJECT_SESSION.md](PROJECT_SESSION.md).

## Probe connection

### Connect ST-Link
You will need an ST-Link probe to flash the firmware to the board.
Two different connectors allow to flash the board:

* J4, a standard 2.54mm header, to be soldered on bottom side
* J3 TagConnect, a pogo pin solution, no soldering needed but you will have to make a custom cable.

#### Pinout
##### DUT connectors
###### J4 JTAG connector
This pinout follows the ST-Link connector pinout, with an additional row for JTAG JTDI.
The second column in only GND, it was added for connector mechanical stability and easy GND access.

##### ST-Link connectors
###### Nucleo ST-Link/V2 pinout CN2
If you are using the ST-Link embedded on a Nucleo board as your debugger, do not forget to remove the 2 jumpers CN2, as shown on the overlay.

* Jumpers equipped: flash the Nucleo
* Jumpers removed: flash an external board connected on CN2

You can even separate the ST-Link part from the Nucleo part with the breakout pads!

###### BlackMagic Probe on STM32F103RCT6 breakout board

This adapter was made following instructions [here](https://stm32world.com/wiki/DIY_STM32_Programmer_(ST-Link/V2-1))
using [a STM32F103 breakout board](https://fr.aliexpress.com/item/1005008154652916.html)

* In order to flash the BlackMagicProbe on the STM32F106 board

| ST-Link connector pin | Name | STM32F106 breakout |
|-----------------------|------|--------------------|
| 1                     | 3V3  | 3V3                |
| 2                     | JTCK | A14                |
| 3                     | GND  | G                  |
| 4                     | JTMS | A13                |
| 5                     | nRST | RST                |

* Once BlackMagic is flashed, the STM32F106 becomes the probe with the following pinout

| ST-Link connector pin | Name | STM32F106 breakout |
|-----------------------|------|--------------------|
| 1                     | 3V3  | NE (R bridge to A0)|
| 2                     | JTCK | A5                 |
| 3                     | GND  | G                  |
| 4                     | JTMS | B14 (100o B12)     |
| 5                     | nRST | B0                 |
| 6                     | JTDO | A6                 |
| 7                     | JTDI | A7                 |

* Pin 4 (SWDIO) needs to be connected to B14 and also to B12 via a 100 ohms resistor
* 3V3 is the target voltage detection, it needs a divide-by-two resistor bridge to A0 to be working correctly

The adapter also provides a target debug UART:

| UART Target | STM32F106 UART | STM32F106 breakout |
|-------------|----------------|--------------------|
| TX          | RX             | A3                 |
| RX          | TX             | A2                 |

In order to install the adapter, you will have to configure udev rules (on Linux) or install
a custom driver (on Windows) so that the BlackMagic probe serial connections will appear with
aliases "/dev/ttyBmpTarg" and "/dev/ttyBmpGdb".

The configuration files are available [here](https://github.com/blackmagic-debug/blackmagic/tree/main/driver).

###### Official ST-LinK/V2
Oh yeah, you can actually by the probe too. Be careful when buying those, there are quite a fair amount of ST-Link counterfeits and not all of them are fully functional.

### Connect UART

No USB-UART chip is provided onboard, you will need to get a third party 3V3 USB-UART gizmo such as the [FTDI one](https://ftdichip.com/products/ttl-232r-3v3/) or any equivalent.

The Zephyr debug UART is set up to be RX2 and TX2, and 115200 2N1.

## Software compilation

Please refer to the [project installation guide](INSTALL.md).

The main application can be built with:

```shell
cd C:\Users\Mathieu\asynthosc\my-workspace
python -m west build -p always -b asynthosc asynthosc_fw/app
```
"-p always" tells the build to clean before build and "-b asynthosc" instructs to build for the
Asynthosc PCB. Building from workspace root keeps all generated files in `my-workspace/build`.

Only one Zephyr source tree is active for this project: `my-workspace/zephyr`.
`asynthosc_fw/zephyr/module.yml` is module metadata, not a second Zephyr source tree.

Then to flash it on the board:
```shell
cd C:\Users\Mathieu\asynthosc\my-workspace
python -m west flash --skip-rebuild --build-dir build --runner blackmagicprobe -- --gdb-serial COM3
```

In order to use a different debug probe than the BlackMagicProbe, use the
runner command switch.

```shell
west flash --runner=stm32cubeprogrammer
```

### Emulation

This project supports emulation.
Left and right pushbuttons are emulated by keyboard left and right.
Rotary encoder click is by keyboard enter.

```shell
west build -b native_sim/native/64 app
```

Then, execute:

```shell
./build/zephyr/zephyr.exe -display_zoom_pct=200
```

### Devicetree Notes (Buttons And CV Mapping)

Current DTS behavior used by `app/src/main.c`:

- Buttons are active-low:
    - `right_button`: `PD3`, `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW`
    - `left_button`: `PD12`, `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW`
    - `rot_button`: `PA8`, `GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW | GPIO_PULL_UP`
- `/zephyr,user` CV properties:
    - `cv-channel-ids = <16 19 3 15>` defines ADC scan order consumed by firmware.
    - `cv-display-remap = <0 2 3 1>` maps ADC index to both UI bar position and OSC CV index.
- `cv-osc-remap` is no longer used by the application path.

### Testing

To execute Twister application tests, run the following command:

```shell
west twister -T app --integration
```

If it’s missing modules, maybe you forgot to activate the right virtual env?

Windows PowerShell (canonical workspace):

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Mathieu\asynthosc\my-workspace
& ".\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
```

Linux/macOS equivalent:

```shell
source ../.venv/bin/activate
```

In order to test the library in details:

```shell
west twister -T tests/lib/tinyosc/ --integration
```

Or to run manually:
```shell
west build -p -b qemu_cortex_m0/nrf51822 tests/lib/tinyosc -T lib.tinyosc
west build -t run
```

Don’t forget to add more tests in tests/lib/tinyosc/src/main.c!

### Notes for USB to OSC

#### Interact with echo server
##### UDP echo server

    ncat -e /bin/cat -k -u -l 4242

##### Server display, not echo

    nc -lu 4242

### Compile Shell over USB support

It means we don’t need an FTDI

    cd C:\Users\Mathieu\asynthosc\my-workspace\zephyr\samples\subsys\shell

    C:\Users\Mathieu\asynthosc\my-workspace\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m west build -p always -b asynthosc ./shell_module -DOVERLAY_CONFIG=overlay-usb.conf -DDTC_OVERLAY_FILE=usb.overlay

### Timestamp retrieve
To be implemented.

Real Time Clock (RTC) is not precise enough for our application.
In order to keep good timing, we use NTP to retrieve a clock through network,
and we update it with a timer.

* NTP provides timestamp in seconds since 1 Jan 1970:
```
struct sntp_time {
    uint64_t seconds;
    uint32_t fraction;
}
```
A value of fraction = N corresponds to N/(2^32) seconds.
The minimal possible value, 1/(2^32) is about 2ns.
NTP is described [here](https://tickelton.gitlab.io/articles/ntp-timestamps/).

* OSC requires timestamps in seconds since 1 Jan 1900
Time tags are represented by a 64 bit fixed point number.
  * The first 32 bits specify the number of seconds since midnight on January 1, 1900
  * The last 32 bits specify fractional parts of a second, to a precision of about 200 picoseconds.
OSC is described [here](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/spec-1_0.html#timetags)

* NTP:
```
samples/net/sockets/sntp_client
```
* Clock skew:

```

### Documentation

A minimal documentation setup is provided for Doxygen and Sphinx. To build the
documentation first change to the ``doc`` folder:

```shell
cd doc
```

Before continuing, check if you have Doxygen installed. It is recommended to
use the same Doxygen version used in [CI](.github/workflows/docs.yml). To
install Sphinx, make sure you have a Python installation in place and run:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

API documentation (Doxygen) can be built using the following command:

```shell
doxygen
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_doxygen`` folder. Similarly, the
Sphinx documentation (HTML) can be built using the following command:

```shell
make html
```

The output will be stored in the ``_build_sphinx`` folder. You may check for
other output formats other than HTML by running ``make help``.
